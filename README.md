# 📱 **Spotify Application**

Welcome to the **Spotify Application** repository! 🎵  
This is a Spring Boot-based application that demonstrates **multithreading** and **JPA** integration using **OpenJPA**. 🎸

---

## ✨ Project Overview  
This project serves as a demonstration of building a **Java Spring Boot** application, utilizing **multithreading** to handle concurrent operations efficiently and **JPA (Java Persistence API)** to manage database interactions.

---

## 🛠️ Key Features  
- **Spring Boot**: Rapid application development using Spring Boot.  
- **Multithreading**: Handling concurrent requests using Java threads.  
- **JPA**: Utilizing Spring Data JPA for database operations.  
- **Database**: MySQL is used as the primary database.
